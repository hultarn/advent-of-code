# Advent Of Code

## Introduction
This project consists of two different parts:

1. Collection of AoC solutions.
2. A Dockerized bot that pulls existing solutions on a cron timer, executes them on the user's dataset, and publishes the result. ✨✨

This can be used when your co-workers have in-house competitions and your timezone doesn't align.
